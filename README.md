Iâ€™m a Quebec based developer and applied maths major. I develop web applications in Rails on Rails and create online presences for small businesses. From collaborating on unique design concepts to using OOD principles to transform ideas into code, I work on all aspects of development projects. 

Iâ€™m currently working on a project called SYNA, a 3D spatial notetaking app that attempts to make note taking less linear and more in line with natural thought processes. Checkout the [full description in it's repo](https://github.com/rosalynnas/syna-prime). I'm also working a concept store called KATO. The intent behind KATO is to curate a collection pre-loved or sustainable clothing and homewares from brands with sustainable visions, strong female leadership, or dedication to creating products that will that will last for generations to come.
