I’m a Quebec based developer and applied maths major. I build web applications in Rails on Rails and create online presences for small businesses. Between collaborating on unique design concepts and using OOD principles to transform ideas into code, I love working on all aspects of a development project.

I’m currently working on a project called SYNA, a 3D spatial notetaking app that attempts to make note taking less linear and more in line with natural thought processes. Checkout the [full description here](https://github.com/rosalynnas/syna-prime). I'm also working a concept store called KATO. The intent behind KATO is to curate a collection pre-loved or sustainable clothing and homewares from brands with sustainable visions, strong female leadership, or dedication to creating products that will that will last for generations to come.
